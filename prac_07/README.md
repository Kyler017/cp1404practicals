## About This Repo and Me

My name is KAN YIJIE, I'M working through the CP1404 Practical Exercises.  
This repo is where I keep all my weekly practical work — from learning basic Python syntax to more advanced concepts like file handling and object-oriented programming.  
I’m building good habits as a coder, like writing clean code, documenting properly, and thinking like a developer.

## What I Learned About Clean Code

Here are 3 important things I’ve learned:

- **One function = one job**  
  If a function does too many things, it’s harder to read. It’s better to split it.

- **Good names help a lot**  
  Names like `language_list` are clear. Names like `x` or `data` don’t help much.

- **Comments explain why, not just what**  
  Write comments to explain *why* you do something, not only what the code does.
